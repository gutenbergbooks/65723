<p><span class="smcap">The</span> number of murders that have taken place,
and the very few murderers that have been
brought to justice in and about London during
the last few months, must go far towards contradicting
the assertion to the effect that the metropolis
of England is ‘the safest city in the world’
to live in. And if to the list of crimes against life
which have not been, and never are likely to be,
brought home to the perpetrators, we add the
innumerable thefts, burglaries, and other offences
against property which go unpunished because the
criminals are never found out, it can hardly be
denied that we require a new departure in the
system of our Detective Police, for the simple
reason that, as at present constituted, the practical
results of the same are very much the reverse
of satisfactory.</p>

<p>It has been my lot, for reasons which need not
be entered into here, to see not a little of the
French detective system, and of the plans adopted
by those employed in discovering crime in Paris.
The two systems, those of the London and
Parisian detective, differ most essentially. With
us, it is as if the general commanding an army in
the field was to send spies into the enemy’s camp,
taking care they were dressed and behaved themselves
in such a manner that every one would
know who they were. On the other hand, the
French system of detection is based on the principle
that the enemy—namely, the criminals
amongst whom they have to make their inquiries—should
never be able to discover who the spies
are. Now, with some fifty or sixty detectives
trained to perfection in the art of disguising themselves,
must it not be far more easy to discover
the whereabouts of crime and the identity of the
criminals, than can possibly be done under our
system? Our detectives are as well known to a
Londoner of any experience, and we may presume
they are also just as well known to the criminal
classes, as if they wore uniform. Nay, in a very
useful volume called <i>The Police Code and Manual
of the Criminal Law</i>, compiled by Mr Howard
Vincent, it is clearly laid down that ‘the idea that
a detective to be useful in a district must be
unknown is erroneous in the great mass of cases,
as he is then unable to distinguish between
honest men who would help a known officer and
others.’</p>

<p>It seems to me, as it must do to all who study
the question, that this is the fundamental mistake
we make, and that it is for this reason our
detection of crime is so defective. We have no
spies in the enemy’s camp. Our detective officers
are merely policemen in shooting-jackets and billycock
hats. The great criminal army knows who
they are as well as if they wore their blue tunics.
A French detective has nothing whatever to do
with arresting criminals. He is not the sportsman
who shoots the bird, but only the dog which points
out where the game is to be found. The French
agents of police, or detectives—many of whom
have been over in England on business, and are
well acquainted with our system—say that our
regular police who keep order in the streets are
the best guardians of peace and order in the
world, but that our detective system is the worst
and, practically, the most useless in Europe. Nor
can any one acquainted with the subject say they
are wrong. Even the most casual readers of the
papers must be struck with two facts relating to
crime in London. In the first place, the vigilance
of the ordinary police is so great, that, as a rule,
they lay hands upon a very great number of
criminals, and cause a vast deal of crime to be
punished. But, on the other hand, if a murderer,
burglar, or other offender against society <i>does</i>
manage to get clean away, he is rarely if ever
caught. The police—that is, of course, the
detective police—invariably ‘get a clue’ to the
affair; and there the matter seems to end. The
detection of crime is evidently not an art that has
been cultivated in England.</p>

<p>The French detective is a man who would
never be thought, by any one who did not know
him personally, to be connected with the police.
In fact, he generally does his best to hide his
real occupation from even his most intimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">{338}</span>
friends. Like our Londoner who is ‘something
in the City,’ he assumes the indefinite appellation
of <i>un employé du gouvernement</i>; but in what office
he is ‘employed,’ or what his ‘employment’ may
be, he refrains from stating. He is generally a
quiet, unpretending individual, who neither courts
nor avoids notice. The facility with which he
assumes all kinds of disguise, and the admirable
manner in which he acts the part he assumes,
must be seen in order to be realised. As a rule,
he takes some time before bringing his inquiries
to a close; but he is rarely at fault in the long-run,
and generally manages to bring down the
game he is hunting.</p>

<p>Our English detective is the exact contrary
of his French <i>confrère</i>. He does not wear uniform,
but he might just as well do so, for his
appearance and dress proclaim him to be what
he is quite as plainly as if he was clad like X142
of the force. He is a well-meaning, intelligent
fellow; but both his want of training and the
system under which he has to work quite unfit
him for the detection of any crime which is hidden
in mystery. I remember, some years ago, being
on a visit at a country-house, where the jewel-case
of a lady visitor was stolen. It was quite
safe when the owner had finished dressing for
dinner; but a couple of hours later her maid
missed it, and gave the alarm. Search was made—it
is needless to say, in vain. The house was
full of visitors, many of whom had brought with
them their own valets and ladies’ maids, besides
which there was a large staff of servants belonging
to the house itself. A telegram was despatched
to Scotland Yard the next morning; and in due
time two detective officers arrived from London.
They examined the room from which the jewel-box
had been taken; questioned, and, as a natural
consequence, set by the ears, all the servants of
the house, as well as those of the different visitors;
made inquiries at the neighbouring railway station
about the travellers who had left the place during
the last few days; and finally, took their departure,
leaving matters exactly where they were—where
they have remained to the present day,
and where they are likely to remain for all
time.</p>

<p>As a comparison with the foregoing, I may
mention a case of a very similar kind which I once
witnessed in Paris. A friend of mine, living
with his wife, daughter, and a male and female
servant <i>au second</i> of a large old-fashioned house,
found one morning that all his plate had been
stolen. It was quite safe when the family went
to bed the previous night; but in the morning
it had vanished. He communicated with the
police; and an elderly gentleman, who looked
like the manager or one of the head-clerks of
a bank, was sent to the house. Neither the
<i>concierge</i> nor any one else had the slightest idea
who the individual was. He came ostensibly
to see my friend on some business, and only told
<i>him</i> what this business really was. He came
again the next day and the following four or
five days, making his visits purposely when my
friend and all his family were out, so as to have
an excuse, whilst awaiting their return, of talking
to the servants, or of wasting a quarter of an
hour in the <i>concierge’s</i> den. He managed to
ingratiate himself with this latter individual;
and in the course of the next few weeks, during
which time he still paid occasional visits, ostensibly
to my friend, became quite intimate with
the servant. It ended in the <i>concierge</i> being
arrested one fine day on a charge of having
stolen the plate. This was brought about partly
by something the detective had seen in the
<i>concierge’s</i> room, but chiefly on account of what
he had heard at a place where a number of the
agents or brokers for stolen goods used to congregate
for business, and to which the detective
went in the character of a thief. The crime
was thus discovered, and the thief was duly
punished.</p>

<p>I mention these two cases, out of not a few
with which I am acquainted, as illustrating in
some measure the very different systems on
which the detectives of England and France do
their work. In the latter country, as in every
other country in Europe, London is regarded by
the dangerous classes as the happy hunting-ground
of thieves and rogues of all kinds. I am fully
aware that many Englishmen would regard the
French detective mode of working as underhand
and mean, and object to what they would term
any underhand work of the kind. But surely
when a question of such magnitude as the detection
of crime is mooted, the authorities ought
not to be guided by what is merely a matter
of sentiment. Murderers, burglars, thieves,
swindlers, and all other evil-doers, do not
hesitate to use the most effectual means at their
command in order to insure success to themselves.
Why, then, should we do so? Crime
of every kind is getting daily more and more
clever and scientific in its working; why should
we not avail ourselves of every possible advantage
which the perpetrators of crime can command?
One thing is very certain, that unless
we take a new departure in the manner we
attempt to detect crime, the dangerous classes
will very soon have everything their own way.
As a French police agent once told me, every
crime that is undiscovered serves as an incentive
for a dozen more of the same kind.</p>

<p>With respect to the very strong dislike which
some persons have to anything in the shape of a
secret police—or rather to disguised agents of the
police acting as spies in the camp of the
dangerous classes—it ought not to be forgotten that
the same prejudice existed half a century ago
against the ‘new police,’ or the ‘Peelers’ as they
were called, being substituted for the watchmen
or ‘Charlies’ of our grandfathers’ days. If the
authorities are wise enough to constitute and
maintain a really efficient system of secret police
agents in the place of what we now call ‘plain-clothes
officers,’ the result will be much the same
as was the substitution of a regular metropolitan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">{339}</span>
police in place of the old watchmen. But if this
greatly called-for change is delayed much longer,
we shall see the criminal classes gaining in
strength every year, until it will become as
difficult to get the mastery over them as is the
case in some of the Western States in America. A
secret police, or rather, a number of secret agents
of the police, organised on the French system,
is what we must institute ere long, and the sooner
it is taken in hand the better. Those who require
their services do not hesitate to employ ‘Private
Inquiry Offices’ and other similar establishments;
why should the government decline to entertain
the idea of such an agency as is here advocated?
If any man of influence and authority in the
land could be present at a ‘business’ meeting
of English, French, and a few German thieves in
some of the lowest haunts of ‘Foreign London,’
an efficient system of secret detective police would
very soon become established in what has been
foolishly called ‘the safest city in the world.’</p>

<p>In England, we have a curious but very
erroneous idea that if a policeman wears a suit
of plain clothes instead of his regular uniform,
he is fully able to find out all about any crime
that has ever been committed. A greater mistake
was never made. Not only to the ‘dangerous
classes,’ but to almost every Londoner who is
anything of an observer regarding his fellow-men,
‘plain-clothes’ officers, as our detectives are called,
are actually as well known as if they wore the
helmet, blue tunic, and black leather waist-belt
of the regular policeman. It is quite otherwise
in France. A French detective, as we have
remarked before, has nothing whatever to do
with serving summonses or warrants. He never
arrests a criminal, but he points out to the regular
police where criminals are to be found. It is
only on very rare occasions that he even appears
as witness against a prisoner; and when he does so,
he assumes for the future a dress and general
appearance quite unlike what he has hitherto
borne. A French detective who cannot disguise
himself in such a manner that his oldest friend
would not be able to recognise him, is not deemed
worth his salary. He takes the greatest professional
pride in this art. In a word, the
French detectives are the spies sent by the army
of law and order to find out all about the enemy
that is constantly waging war against life and
property. In England, we have no similar set
of men, and what are the consequences? Why,
that unless a murderer, burglar, or other offender
is either taken red-handed, or leaves behind him
some very plain marks as to who he is or where
he is to be found, crime with us is, as a rule,
undetected. Sooner or later, notwithstanding our
national prejudices against all that is secret and
underhand, we must adopt a system for the
detection of crime on the plan that is found to
work so well in France; and the sooner we do
so the better, unless we want to make England
in general, and London in particular, more than
even it is now the happy hunting-ground of all
the scoundrels in Europe. All Frenchmen who
have visited our country say that our <i>ordinary</i>
police is the very best in the world; that the
manner in which they preserve order in the
streets is above praise; and they are right. Nor
can a word be said against the character, the
integrity, or the intentions also of our detectives.
But the system on which they are trained is
essentially bad. They are the wrong men in
the wrong place—the square pegs in the round
holes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX.—CURIOUS.</h3>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">I am</span> going to the village, Ada, to see Mr
Beecham, but I shall not be long,’ said Wrentham
to his wife.</p>

<p>She in her pale, delicate prettiness was as
unlike the mate of such a man as Wrentham
as a gazelle linked to a Bengal tiger would appear.
But she was fond of him, believed in him, and was
as happy in her married state as most of her
neighbours seemed to be. Indeed, she believed
herself to be a great deal happier than most of
them. So far as the household arrangements
were concerned, he was a model husband: he
interfered with none of them. He seldom scolded:
he accepted his chop or steak with equanimity
whether it was over or under done (of course he
did not think it necessary to mention the repasts
he indulged in at the <i>Gog and Magog</i>); and he
had even put on a pair of unbrushed boots
without saying anything aloud. What woman
is there who would not appreciate such a husband?</p>

<p>Mrs Wrentham did appreciate him, and was
devoted to him. She had brought him a few
hundreds, with which her father, a country tradesman,
had dowered her, and of that Wrentham
declared he was able to make a fortune. With
that intent most of his time was occupied in the
City; and she often lamented that poor Martin
was so eager to make ‘hay whilst the sun shone’—as
he called it—that he was working himself to
death.</p>

<p>‘Never mind, dear,’ he would say: ‘there is
no time like the present for laying by a store;
and we shall have leisure to enjoy ourselves when
we have made a comfortable little fortune.’</p>

<p>‘But if you should kill yourself in the meanwhile,
Martin!’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense, Ada; I am too tough a chap to be
killed so easily.’</p>

<p>Then he would go off gaily to the City (or the
betting-ring). She would sigh, and sit down to
wait for the happy time when that little fortune
should be made.</p>

<p>The man whilst he spoke to her was sincere
enough; but in the feverish excitement of his
speculations he forgot all about wife and home.</p>

<p>At present he was at ease, for he did not mean
to go farther than the <i>King’s Head</i>. So he made
the little woman quite happy by his effusive
tenderness, and still more by the information
that she might wait up for his return. What
pleasanter intimation could a loving wife receive?</p>

<p>The village was in darkness, for gas had not
yet found its way into Kingshope. The feeble
glint of a candle here and there looked like a
dull glowworm striving to keep up a semblance
of life. The half-dozen shops with their oil-lamps
were a little brighter than the houses;
but their innermost corners were dark and
mysterious. Even the <i>King’s Head</i> and <i>Cherry
Tree</i> wore such veils upon their faces that a
stranger would have passed by without suspecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">{340}</span>
that these were hostelries within the gates of
which was to be found good entertainment for
man and beast, and where on market-days and
fair-days were held high revels.</p>

<p>In one of the darkest parts of the street there
was a little window illuminated by a single ‘dip:’
that ‘dip’ revealed a jumble of sweetmeats, cheap,
gaudy toys, and penny picture-books. The eager
eyes of a group of children discovered there a
palace of wonder and delight, filled with objects
of surpassing interest and ambition. There was
a wooden sword which young Hodge regarded as
more powerful than his father’s spade and pick-axe:
there was a gilt gingerbread man with a
cocked-hat, which was looked upon with breathless
admiration as a correct model of the Prince
of Wales in all the splendour of royal attire.
There was a brief discussion as to whether the
cocked-hat should not have been a gold crown,
which was undoubtedly the proper headgear for
a prince. This, however, was settled by a mite
of a girl, who suggested that the cocked-hat was
worn when the Prince went out for a walk, and
the crown when he was in the palace.</p>

<p>Next in attractive power was a greenish bottle
full of brandy-balls; and the children’s teeth
watered as they gazed upon it. A Lord Mayor’s
dinner must be a small thing compared with that
window with its jumble of sweets and toys.</p>

<p>‘Wouldn’t you like to have some of these nice
things? How happy we would be if life could
be all gilt gingerbread and brandy-balls!’</p>

<p>That was exactly what they had been thinking,
and an appalled silence fell upon the little group,
as they turned to stare at the wizard who had
read their desire through the backs of their heads.
But they all knew the kindly face of the gentleman
who was looking at them so pleasantly.
They did not note the shade of sadness and pity
that was in his eyes. The faces of the younger
children broadened into smiles of expectation:
the elder ones hung their heads a little—shy,
doubting, hoping, and vaguely fearing that they
had been caught doing something wrong.</p>

<p>Mr Beecham patted one of them on the head—a
child of about six years.</p>

<p>‘Suppose you had sixpence, Totty, what would
you do?’</p>

<p>‘Buy all the shop.’</p>

<p>‘And what then?’</p>

<p>‘Eat um,’ was the prompt and emphatic answer.</p>

<p>‘What! would you not share with your
friends?’</p>

<p>Totty looked round at her friends, who were
anxious about her next reply.</p>

<p>‘Such a lot of ’em,’ she said with a kind of sulky
greediness.</p>

<p>‘Well, sixpence will not buy the whole shop;
but I shall give it to your brother, and he must
spend it upon something which can be easily
divided into equal parts, so that you may all
share alike.’</p>

<p>The gift was accepted in silence; but he had
only moved a few paces away when there arose
a hubbub of young voices angrily disputing as
to what should be purchased with their fortune.
He turned back and settled the matter for them.
Whilst thus occupied, he was visited with the
unpleasant reflection that what we want does not
cause us so much trouble as what we possess.
These children had been happy gazing at what
they had no expectation of attaining. In imagination
they could pick and choose each what he or
she most fancied. Then he had come like an evil
genius amongst them and by his trifling gift had
produced discord. Had he purchased all that was
in the shop there would still have been dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>‘Communism will never thrive,’ he muttered
as he walked away, after pacifying his little
protégés as best he could; ‘the selfish individual
will always be too strong for it. Master Philip
is making a mistake.’</p>

<p>‘He <i>is</i> a rum chap,’ was the comment of Mr
Wrentham, who had been watching the incident
from the outside of the small semicircle of light
cast from the window of the sweet-shop. ‘In his
dotage?... No. I might have said that, if we
had not spent a few evenings together. A man
who can pick up Nap and play it as he did, is
no fool, however much of a knave he may be.
He is not that either.... Wonder what can be
the reason of Hadleigh’s curiosity about him.’</p>

<p>His first movement from the darkness in which
he stood suggested that he purposed saluting Mr
Beecham at once; but he altered his mind, lit
a cigar, and strolled leisurely after him. He had
found a new interest in the stranger: it sprung
out of his profound respect for Mr Hadleigh, for
he was convinced that every word spoken by that
gentleman, and certainly every act performed by
him, was the result of careful reflection and shrewd
foresight. He was not a man to do anything
without a distinct view to his own advantage.
Wrentham intended to share that advantage.
But as he was at present unable to conceive what
it might be, and was working entirely in the dark,
with the hope merely that he should discover the
meaning of it all as he proceeded, he considered
it wise to move with caution whilst he maintained
the bearing of a most willing servant.</p>

<p>He had been under the impression that he had
sounded the depths of Mr Beecham’s character
pretty correctly; but Mr Hadleigh’s inquiries and
the incident with the children suggested two such
opposite phases, that Wrentham could only conclude
one of them must be wrong. Mr Hadleigh
had started the suspicion that Beecham had some
design in hand, the discovery of which would be
useful: the scene with the children brought
Wrentham back to his first impression—that he
was a simple-minded but clear-sighted gentleman
who was willing to lose a few pounds at cards
occasionally without grumbling.</p>

<p>Mr Beecham had so few visitors in his village
quarters, that he had not yet found it necessary
to give the attendants at the <i>King’s Head</i> the
unpalatable but frequently unavoidable instruction
to say ‘Not at home.’ So that, on Wrentham’s
arrival, his name was at once conveyed to him.
The message brought back was that, if Mr Wrentham
would be good enough to wait for a few
minutes, Mr Beecham would be ready to receive
him.</p>

<p>When at length he was shown into the room,
Mr Beecham was closing a large envelope, which
he placed on his desk in order to shake hands
with his visitor. At each side of the desk was
a bright lamp with a white shade, reflecting the
light full upon the document he had laid down.
Wrentham had no difficulty in reading the
address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">{341}</span></p>

<p>‘Hope I am not disturbing you. Got home
early, and took it into my head to come down and
have a cigar and a chat. If you’re busy, I’ll
bolt.’</p>

<p>‘No necessity. I had only to address an
envelope to a friend with some inclosures, and
that is done. You are very welcome to-night,
although we are not likely to have a chat, as I
have invited some young people to a conjuring
entertainment.’</p>

<p>‘I am afraid you will find me an ungracious
guest,’ said Wrentham, laughing, ‘for I had made
up my mind to have a quiet evening with you
alone, and I have no fancy for jugglers—their
tricks are all so stale.’</p>

<p>‘You will find this man particularly amusing.
He is clever with his tongue as well as his hands,
and is remarkably well-mannered, although you
will be astonished, perhaps, to learn that he is
only a street performer. I ought not to have
told you that until after you had seen him.
However, my chief pleasure will be—and I am
sure yours will be—in seeing how the children
enjoy the magician’s wonders. Mr Tuppit tells
me that he never has so much delight in his
work as when he has an audience of young
people. We have got the large dining-room for
the performance, and it is likely to turn out a
brilliant affair. You must stay.’</p>

<p>At the mention of the conjurer’s name, Wrentham
made a curious movement, as if he had
dropped something—it was only the ash of his
cigar which had fallen on his sleeve. He dusted
it into the fender.</p>

<p>‘I wish I could go into things of this sort
like you,’ he said, smiling admiringly at Mr
Beecham’s enthusiasm; ‘but I can’t. I don’t
believe you could do it either, if you had heavy
and anxious work on hand. But you belong to
the lucky ones who have successfully passed the
Rubicon of life. You have made your hay, and
can amuse yourself without thinking about to-morrow.
I am never allowed to get to-morrow
out of my head.’</p>

<p>‘Most people say that,’ was Mr Beecham’s
response, with one of his quiet smiles; ‘and I
always think it is because we waste to-day in
thinking of to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘Hit again,’ exclaimed Wrentham with a frank
laugh. ‘I believe you are right; but we cannot
all be philosophers. Nature has most to do in
forming us, whatever share education may have
in it. Where the dickens did you pick up your
philosophy? In the east, west, north, or south?
Have you been a traveller for pleasure or on
business? Where have you been? What have
you done, that you should be able always to see
the sunny side of life? There’s a string of
questions for you. Don’t trouble to answer them,
although I should like if possible to learn how
you became what you are—so calm, so happy.’</p>

<p>All this was spoken so good-humouredly—as if
it were the outcome of nothing more than jesting
curiosity—that Wrentham fancied he had very
cleverly turned to useful account a passing observation.
His host could not avoid giving him
some direct information about his career now.</p>

<p>Mr Beecham appeared to be amused—nothing
more.</p>

<p>‘I have travelled in many directions of the
compass, partly on business, partly on pleasure.
Everywhere I have found that although the scenes
are different, men are the same. Those who have
had a fortune made for them spend it, wisely or
unwisely as may be; those who have not, strive
or wish to strive to make one for themselves.
Some succeed, some fail: but the conditions of
happiness are the same in either case—those
who are the most easily content are the most
happy.’</p>

<p>‘Beaten,’ thought Wrentham. ‘What a clever
beggar he is in answering the most direct
questions with vague generalities.’ What he said
was this:</p>

<p>‘I suppose that you had a fortune made for
you, and so could take things easy?’</p>

<p>‘A little was left to me, but I am glad to say
not enough to permit me to be idle. I cannot
say that I have worked hard, but I worked in the
right direction, and the result has been satisfactory—that
is, so far as money is concerned.’</p>

<p>‘Wish you would give me a leaf out of your
book: it might start me in the right direction
too.’</p>

<p>‘Some day you shall have the whole book to
read, Mr Wrentham, and I shall be delighted if
you find it of service.’</p>

<p>‘But what line were you in? I should like
to know.’</p>

<p>‘So you shall, so you shall—by-and-by.—You
have allowed your cigar to go out. Try one of
these Larranagas; and excuse me for a minute—I
want to send this away.’</p>

<p>He took up the packet which Wrentham had
observed lying on the desk, and quitted the room.</p>

<p>‘Wish I could make him out,’ was Wrentham’s
reflection, as, after lighting his cigar, he stood on
the hearth with his back to the fire and glared
round the room in search of something that
might help to satisfy his curiosity. ‘Maybe there
is nothing to make out.... But what does he
want sending off letters to Madge Heathcote at
this time of evening? I saw the address plainly
enough, and that letter was for her.... There
<i>is</i> something to find out.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ASHBURNHAM_COLLECTIONS">THE ASHBURNHAM COLLECTIONS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1763, Mr Grenville, then First Lord of the
Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer, had
occasion to enlist the services of a gentleman
familiar with ancient handwriting, in the arrangement
of papers and other business. So well did
Mr Thomas Astle do his work, that, two years
later, he was made Receiver-general on the Civil
List; subsequently becoming, in succession, chief
clerk in the Record Office, and keeper of the
records in the Tower. Astle was a diligent and
discreet collector of manuscripts; and mindful
of his obligations to the Grenvilles, directed by
his will that his valuable library should pass into
the possession of the Marquis of Buckingham for
the sum of five hundred pounds. That nobleman
gladly accepted the conditional bequest, and
housed the sometime keeper’s treasures honourably
at Stowe. As opportunities offered, he and his
successor added books and documents to Astle’s
store, until they had brought together a mass of
original materials for the history of the three
kingdoms unrivalled by any other private collection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">{342}</span></p>

<p>The middle of the present century saw Stowe
shorn of its glories; and in 1849, its famous
manuscripts were advertised for public sale; but
their threatened dispersion was fortunately averted
by the Earl of Ashburnham purchasing the entire
collection, and adding it to his own extensive
library, rich in works of early European and
English literature. At the time of the earl’s
death he was the possessor of four distinct collections,
known as the Stowe, the Barrois, the
Libri, and the Appendix. The last-named, representing
his occasional purchases, consisted of two
hundred and fifty volumes, including richly illuminated
missals and Books of Hours, choice copies
of the works of Chaucer, Wickliffe, Gower, Dante;
English chronicles, monastic registers, and individual
manuscripts of great rarity and value.
The Barrois collection of seven hundred and two
manuscripts was notable for its specimens of
ancient bindings, its illuminated manuscripts, and
its examples of early French literature; while
the Libri section was remarkable for its very
ancient manuscripts, its copies of Dante’s Commedia,
its works of early Italian literature, its
rare autographs, and its letters of distinguished
French men of science.</p>

<p>In 1879, all these treasures were offered by the
present Earl of Ashburnham to the trustees of the
British Museum for the sum of one hundred and
sixty thousand pounds; but upon their requesting
him to separate the manuscripts from the
printed books, the earl intimated that, finding he
had underpriced his library in the first instance,
he should require the hundred and sixty thousand
pounds for the manuscripts alone; or fifty thousand
for the Stowe collection, and fifty thousand
for the Appendix collection, if the trustees elected
to buy them only; and with that intimation the
negotiation ended. In the autumn of 1882 the
Museum authorities sought Lord Ashburnham
again, to learn that he would only sell the collection
as a whole at the price he had originally
named. The keeper of the department of Manuscripts
went down to Ashburnham Place, examined
the collection volume by volume, and returned
with above nine hundred of the choicest volumes
and portfolios of papers, for the inspection of the
trustees themselves; and they came to the conclusion
that, all things considered, the collection
was worth the money demanded for it; and
recommended the Treasury to purchase it, and
give the trustees power to make over certain
portions of the Libri and Barrois collections—said
to have been abstracted from the public
libraries of France—to the French government
on payment of twenty-four thousand pounds.
To this proposition the Treasury would not
agree, not being prepared to purchase the collection
<i>en bloc</i>.</p>

<p>Then Lord Ashburnham agreed to sell the
Museum the Stowe and Appendix divisions for
ninety thousand pounds. The Treasury offered
seventy thousand pounds; whereupon the earl
requested that the manuscripts in the possession
of the Museum trustees should be returned to
their proper home. Determined, if possible, to
avert what they regarded as an irreparable
national calamity, the trustees proposed to make
good the twenty thousand pounds by allowing
a reduction on the annual vote for the Museum
to the amount of four thousand pounds for the
next five years. ‘My Lords’ were obdurate, the
earl was firm; and the disappointed Museum
trustees had nothing left to them but to retire
with an expression of their regret at the untoward
result of their efforts to save the precious manuscripts
from probable expatriation. A week or two
later, however, they were gladdened by receiving
a verbal intimation from the guardian of the
public purse that the government were ready
to purchase the Stowe collection provided it
could be obtained for forty thousand pounds.
Lord Ashburnham would not lower his demand
to that extent, but consented to accept forty-five
thousand pounds. So the bargain was struck,
the House of Commons voted the money, and the
much-talked-of manuscripts became the property
of the nation.</p>

<p>Whatever the pecuniary value of the Stowe
collection may be, the custodians of our great
library may well rejoice upon acquiring its nine
hundred and ninety-six volumes of charters and
cartularies; ancient missals and rituals; old
English chronicles; old statutes; reports of
famous trials; household books; royal wardrobe
accounts; papal bulls and indulgences; historical,
legal, and ecclesiastical documents; diplomatic,
political, and private correspondence; and papers
of more or less value to the antiquary, genealogist,
and general student. In truth, the subject-matter
of this mass of manuscripts is of so varied a nature
that it would almost be easier to say what is not,
than what is to be found therein. We shall not
attempt to do either, but content ourselves with
enumerating some of the curiosities of the collection.</p>

<p>First among these comes a volume of Anglo-Saxon
charters, the cover of which is adorned
with figures of saints and martyrs, and a representation
of the crucifixion, worked with the
needle, in coloured silks and gold-thread. The
first charter in the volume is one of six lines,
by which Withred, king of Kent, granted certain
lands to the nuns of Liming; His Majesty, ‘being
illiterate,’ making the sign of the cross against
his name. Another relic of Anglo-Saxon times
is the register of Hyde Abbey, Winchester, the
greater part of which is supposed to have been
written in the reign of Canute. On the first page
are portraits of that monarch and his queen
‘Ailgythu’ in their robes of state. On the fourth
leaf are memoranda of the Conqueror’s building
a palace at Winchester, and of the burning of the
city in 1140 by Robert, Earl of Gloucester. A
copy of Alfred’s will is followed by an account
of the burying-places of the Anglo-Saxon kings
and saints, various forms of benedictions, a list
of relics preserved at Hyde, and a calendar of
saints. On one page is a fragment of the <i>exultat</i>
as chanted on Holy Saturday in the monastery,
with the musical notes—consisting of lines and
points placed over the syllables, and indicating
by their forms the high and low tones in which
these syllables were to be sung.</p>

<p>Of historical interest are—the original report
of the trial of ‘Johanne d’Arc,’ dated the 7th of
July 1456, and duly signed and attested by the
notaries; the original declaration of eight of the
bishops in favour of Henry VIII.’s assumption
of power in church matters, in which they pronounce
that Christian princes may make ecclesiastical
laws; and two little volumes—one about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">{343}</span>
three inches square, containing sundry calendars
and tables, written on leaves of vellum, and
bearing on the fly-leaf, in the handwriting of the
Duke of Somerset: ‘Fere of the lord is the
begenning of wisdume: put thi trust in the
lord w<sup>h</sup> all thine heart; be not wise in thyne
own conseyte but fere the lord and fle from evele
frome the toware the day before deth, 1551.
<span class="smcap">E. Somerset</span>.’ The other booklet is about an
inch square, and bound in gold, enamelled in
black, and furnished with two small gold rings,
by which it could be suspended to its owner’s
waist. It consists of a hundred and ninety-six
pages of vellum, on which are written the seven
penitential psalms. This was one of Henry VIII.’s
gifts to Anne Boleyn, and was given by her—Horace
Walpole says—to her maid of honour
Mrs Wyatt, when the beautiful queen bade farewell
to the world on Tower Hill.</p>

<p>Among other originals of political importance
may be noted the return concerning the levy of
ship-money, made to Sir Peter Temple, High-sheriff
of Bucks, from the parish of Great Kimble,
bearing the names of those who tendered their
refusal to the constables and assessors; the said
constables’ and assessors’ names appearing in the
list of protesters, at the head of which stands the
name of John Hampden. Of a little later date
is the secret article of the treaty made in 1654
between Louis XIV. and the Protector of England
for the expulsion from France of Charles II., the
Duke of York, and eighteen royalists; Cromwell
undertaking in return to expel certain Frenchmen
from England. This document is signed by De
Bordeaux on the part of the French king; by
Fiennes, Lisle, and Strickland on the part of
the Commonwealth. The Grand Monarch’s own
signature appears to an order addressed to the
governor of the Bastile—an order for him to
permit the Countess de Bussy to sleep with her
husband.</p>

<p>There are two literary curiosities in the shape
of a five-act tragedy by Bale, Bishop of Ossory,
who died in 1563; and a comedy, author
unknown, intended to be played for the amusement
of Elizabeth and her court; the latter
ending with the following lines, addressed to
Queen Bess:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">May you have all the joys of innocence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Injoyinge too all the delights of sense.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May you live long, and knowe till ye are told,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">T’ endeare your beauty, and wonder you are old;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when heaven’s heate shall draw you to the skye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May you transfigured, not transfigured dye!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the original draft of a dedication to be
prefixed to some operas by Purcell, Dryden says:
‘Musick and poetry have ever been acknowledged
sisters, which walking hand-in-hand support each
other. As poetry is the harmony of words, so
musick is that of notes; and as poetry is a rise
above prose and oratory, so is musick the exaltation
of poetry. Both of them may excel apart;
but sure they are most excellent when they are
joined, because nothing is then wanting to either
of their perfections, for thus they appear like
wit and beauty in the same person.’ At the end
of a copy of Bacon’s <i>Essays</i>, presented to Mrs
Newsham, in 1725, by ‘her servant, A. Pope,’ is
a sonnet in the poet’s handwriting, entitled <i>A
Wish to Mrs M. B. on her Birthday, June 15</i>. It
is to be found in his works, expanded into a
twenty-line <i>Epistle to Miss Martha Blount, on her
Birthday</i>.</p>

<p>‘The Emperor of Morocco’s curses against his
two eldest sons, taken from the original in his
own writing in the register of the principal
church at Morocco,’ is a curiosity, if scarcely a
literary one; and the same may be said of a
specimen of French penmanship—a series of
portraits of the time of Louis XIV., executed
with such freedom that they seem to have been
done with one uninterrupted flourish of the pen.
Each portrait has a song with music appended to
it, the volume ending with a piece of music in
Rousseau’s own hand, composed by him at
Paris in 1776.</p>

<p>The letters, original and transcribed, in the
collection are so multitudinous, that it is impossible
to enter into detail about them; they cover
every reign from Edward III. to George III.,
and unrepresented Englishmen of any note are
few indeed; while epistles written by such illustrious
foreigners as Doge Andrea Contarini,
Francis I., Cardinal Mazarin, Louis XIV., Madame
de Maintenon, Voltaire, Frederick the Great,
Mirabeau, Lafayette, and Napoleon the Great,
figure in the catalogue of contents.</p>

<p>We must mention that among the treasures
acquired by the nation are a number of manuscripts
in the Irish language, and of manuscripts
relating to the history and antiquities of Ireland;
besides the correspondence of Arthur Capel,
Earl of Essex, Lord-lieutenant of Ireland under
Charles II. The government having decided that
manuscripts in the Irish language, and those
bearing more or less directly upon Irish history
and literature, should be lent indefinitely to the
Royal Irish Academy, for the use of students and
the public, the greater portion of the above will
be lost to Bloomsbury—how large a portion will
not be known, until the representatives of the
British Museum and the Irish Academy have
settled the matter between them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_SKETCH_FROM_MY_STUDY_WINDOW">A SKETCH FROM MY STUDY WINDOW.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were three of them, little pale-faced, grave-eyed
girl-children, unmistakable Londoners in
their lack of the healthy colouring and sturdy
limbs which would have marked country-bred
children of their age. The eldest was perhaps
eleven; the younger ones, eight and six years
old respectively; and it was pretty, as well as
pathetic, to see the prematurely motherly care
which the eldest sister—whom the little ones
called ‘Gertie’—bestowed upon the tiny mite
whose responsible protector she seemed to be.</p>

<p>When first I noticed them, they were walking
demurely round the gravel-path of the square upon
which my study window looks out. Each had a
skipping-rope dangling loosely from her hands;
and the younger ones were evidently intent upon
some grave story from the lips of their sister.
Presently, they came along the upper side of the
garden, towards my window, and I had my first
glimpse of their faces. Each was pretty in her
childish way. The eldest, tall for her age, slight
and dark, had regular features and soft brown
eyes, whose naturally pathetic expression was
heightened by the deep mourning-frock and
crape-trimmed hat which each alike was wearing.
The two younger children were less noticeable in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">{344}</span>
appearance, the second being, I fancied, ordinarily
a merry, dimpled little maiden, whom, but for
some temporary cloud on her spirits, I could
more easily have pictured enjoying a good game
of romps with some of the other small frequenters
of our garden; and the youngest, like Gertrude,
a pensive-faced baby, with sadly transparent
colouring and fragile figure, betokening constitutional
delicacy. It was summer-time; and as
they passed beneath my widely opened window,
I caught the word ‘Mother’ two or three times
repeated, gravely pronounced by Gertie; and I
judged, from the reverent expression of the three
little faces and from their deep mourning, that
she was recalling to the memory of her charges
some childish reminiscences of a recently lost
parent.</p>

<p>I had certainly never seen them before, or,
child-worshipper that I was, I could not have
failed to recognise them. All the other young
people in the garden—from Tommy, surname
unknown, aged two, with a penchant for sticky
sweetmeats, and an aversion to nurses, to Miss
Mildred Holford, verging upon sweet seventeen,
and alternating between spasmodic propriety and
innate tomboyism—were intimately known to me—by
sight, at all events; and in my idle speculations
upon the little strangers, I jumped to the
conclusion—subsequently verified—that they were
new-comers to one of the large empty houses
facing mine on the further side of our square.</p>

<p>From that day forward I saw them frequently,
generally, as on the first occasion, alone, the eldest
in charge of the younger ones, sometimes accompanied
by a tall lady, also in deep mourning, whom
they addressed as ‘auntie;’ sometimes with a
sober, matronly looking nurse, who carried in her
arms a bundle of white drapery, enveloping what
I opined to be a baby of tender weeks. This baby
was the favourite toy of the three little sisters.
Nothing else possessed the slightest attraction for
them when their tiny brother was present; and
it was a pretty study to watch the pride and
delight of the two elder girls, when their nurse
allowed each in turn to carry the white-robed
atom a few steps away from her side and back
again. Nor was little Ethel, the youngest of the
trio, debarred from the privilege of playing nurse
sometimes. Too weak and frail to be safely
trusted to carry the precious burden, it was her
chief delight to sit, still as a mouse, on the corner
of one of the garden-seats, crooning and talking
baby-talk to the unconscious morsel on her lap,
while the nurse and elder girls kept guard at a
few yards’ distance, their absence being clearly
a highly valued condition of this innocent ‘confidence-trick.’</p>

<p>Morning after morning, throughout the first
week of their residence in our square, was the
same routine carried out; the younger ones
sometimes indulging in a run with their hoops,
from Gertie’s side; sometimes amusing themselves
with dolls or skipping-ropes; or again
listening while their aunt or Gertrude read aloud
to them. But on Saturday morning they did not
appear as usual, and I found myself quite missing
their company, and puzzling myself with vague
speculations to account for their absence. Even
in this short time my heart had gone out towards
the little motherless girls, and I had begun unconsciously
to weave fanciful theories of their past
and present life, to account for the sweet seriousness
and precocious womanly airs of the eldest
girl, and the influence of love—for her manner
was untinged by any assumption of elder-sisterly
prerogative—which she clearly possessed and
exercised over the younger ones. Rightly or
wrongly, I never knew, but I pictured them the
children of parents separated by a long interval
of years in age, but united by strong bonds of
confidence and affection. Gertrude’s sedate air
suggested that she had been rather the companion
than the plaything of her mother; and that the
mother’s influence had been tender, without
caprice, was apparent from her child’s gentle
gravity, and from the unquestioning attention
paid to her lightest hint or remonstrance by the
younger sisters. The words, ‘Mother would not
have wished it,’ or, ‘Father would not like to
see it,’ from her lips were sufficient in a moment
to quell Edith’s occasional fractiousness, or to dry
Ethel’s ready tears; while the confidence existing
between all three was enough to show that no
undue favouritism had ever wakened jealousy
of one another. Unselfish to a fault, Gertrude
was the one to give way in every question of
mere personal preference; but she never swerved
from her adherence to what she believed would
be ‘mother’s’ wish or course of action, and an
appeal from her opinion to aunt or nurse was
rare indeed.</p>

<p>Such were some of my dreams of these little
ones that Saturday morning. Luncheon-time
came, and passed, without a sign; and so restless
and idle had I been all morning, owing to the
absurd interest I had taken in the non-appearance
of my little friends, that, contrary to my usual
custom, I was obliged to forego my half-holiday
and settle to work again. Suddenly, glancing
from my book for the thousandth time that day,
I spied the little trio approaching. They looked
less grave than usual, and were manifestly preoccupied,
as I judged from the frequent glances
cast by one and all towards the entrance-gate, at
the far corner of the square. At last the cause
became evident. The gate swung open, and an
elderly gentleman in deep mourning came hastily
into the garden. He was quickly perceived;
and with a glad cry of ‘Father!’ all three
children scampered off to meet him. ‘Father’s’
half-holiday was clearly the event of the
week for his little motherless girls; and for the
first time since I had seen her, the sad cloud
passed from Gertie’s eyes, and for a few hours
was lost in the light of unalloyed happiness.
Under ‘father’s’ generalship they played merry
childish games, laughing and romping as I had
never yet deemed it possible they could laugh or
romp; and when the delicate little Ethel grew
weary and could play no longer, there was a
knee for each of the younger pets, and a seat
at her father’s side for Gertrude, while it
was evident that he was spinning yarns and
racking his brains for fairy tales, each of
which was rewarded with unanimous applause,
and reiterated calls upon the narrator’s memory
or invention. So passed the happy holiday
afternoon, a peaceful idyll in the great prose
volume of London life; and when at length the
father rose from his seat, and, with a tiny hand
in each of his, moved slowly homewards, I felt
as if the colour had faded out of the summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">{345}</span>
evening, and the workaday clouds had begun to
close in upon me again.</p>

<p>So the July days glided by, bringing no greater
change into the lives of my three little maidens
than the regular alternations of grave morning
walks and gay Saturday afternoon romps. They
seemed shy of making friends among their light-hearted
young neighbours; and the other children
appeared to be awed and checked in their advances
by the sombre crape and sedate looks of the new-comers.
Now and then, a timid overture was
made, generally to Edith, the second of the trio,
whose dimpled cheeks looked more suggestive
of successful negotiation than her sisters’ demure
faces; but such attempts were rare, and as a rule,
my own unsuspected interest was the only notice
taken of their doings, and they were left unmolested
in the pursuit of their quiet routine.</p>

<p>By-and-by my vacation-time arrived, and I
left the heat and bustle of London for a country
rest. On my return, the days had shortened
perceptibly, the sun was shorn of half his brightness,
the garden trees were shedding their leaves,
and autumn fogs and winter frosts were approaching
apace. There, as usual, on the first morning
after my return to work, were the little ladies.
But there were no longer quiet hours of basking
in sunshine on the seats, and much of the sober
confabulation seemed to have taken wing with
the flight of their summer surroundings. Time
was acting its usual part as the disperser of clouds
and lightener of hearts. ‘Mother’ had become
less a recent reality than a sweet occasional
memory, and the young blood of the younger
sisters called for more active exercise than the
grave promenade that had sufficed previously.</p>

<p>But as autumn faded into winter, and the
London sky donned its accustomed leaden-hued
uniform, the fireside usurped the attractions of
the window-seat, and but for an occasional glimpse,
accidentally caught as I passed the window, I
lost sight of my little triad of maidens.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The spring of 187- was unusually late in
making its appearance. The sun sullenly refused
to pierce the shroud of fog and mist; the buds
seemed reluctant to shed their outer coats, and
unfold their tender greenery to the dangers of
frost and blighting east wind. The grass was
still discoloured and sodden in our garden, and
the costermonger appeared to have forgotten his
customers in our square, so tardy was he in
making the welkin ring with his hoarse vindication
of his wares, ‘All a-blowin’ and a-growin’.’
Though the almanac stoutly averred that we
had entered upon the ‘merrie month of May,’
a fire was still an absolute essential for comfort,
and I hesitated long before wheeling my writing-table
to the window and taking up my fine-weather
quarters. However, the move was at
length made; and the first group that met my
eyes, as they wandered from my work to the outer
world, was the now familiar one of the ‘serious
family.’ But they were no longer alone; with
them walked a middle-aged lady, of precise and
dignified aspect, whom it required but slight
knowledge of female human nature to identify
as a governess. The little ones too were changed.
Gertie and Edith had grown apace. The former,
prettier and even more demure than of yore, had
shot up into a tall slip of a girl, giving promise
of graceful figure and carriage, though as yet
showing the angularity and awkwardness of too
rapid growth. Edith was more roguish-looking,
and a trifle less roundabout than before, and had
clearly a fine fund of animal spirits, longing for
a chance of making their escape. But Ethel!
Alas! more plainly than ever were the sure signs
of delicacy noticeable in the sweet wee face and
unnaturally deep-set eyes. She had lost rather
than gained ground during the long severe winter.
The effort to take part even in her sisters’ quiet
sports was clearly beyond her strength, and
it was sad indeed to catch the patient, hopeless
expression with which she urged her weariness,
as a plea for resisting Edith’s thoughtless, childish
allurements.</p>

<p>Before long, I noticed that she had given up
the attempt to join the play; and Edith herself
was forced to recognise her plea, and to find
allies in her romps among the other small-fry
in the gardens, with many of whom she had now
struck up acquaintance. Presently, even the daily
walk grew to be too much for the feeble little
frame, and a miniature carriage was devised, in
which, tended constantly and lovingly by her
eldest sister, she spent her outdoor hours. Many
a long silent morning did she while away under
the trees, the baby on her lap, and the sweet
child-voice of her devoted sister reading to her,
or telling her stories, with unwearying patience.
Many a time have I paused in my work to watch
the sad drama of pure unselfish love. Many a
Saturday afternoon have I spent at my window,
unable to turn away from the simple yet solemn
scene, enacted in that commonplace London
square, to seek pleasure and distraction among
the busy haunts of river-side or park.</p>

<p>Those Saturday half-holidays were no longer
joyous festivals for the father and children. His
coming was as regular, and as eagerly looked for,
as ever; but now there was no glad rush to
meet him at the gate, no merry romps, in which
he was the youngest child among the group. He
saw, all too clearly, and Gertrude too had long
since recognised, the inevitable parting that was
slowly but surely approaching, and the tender
devotion of both parent and sister was touching
indeed to witness. Again a little while, and the
bright summer sun, falling on the garden and
its merry groups of children, kissed the little
pale cheek no more. I could see the sudden
pause in game and romp, when the two sisters
appeared as usual for their morning walk. I
could see the players hasten to their side, and
could imagine the eager inquiries for the little
invalid, the looks and words of childish sympathy
offered with heartfelt though transient earnestness,
before they turned away to resume their games,
claiming Edith as a playmate, and leaving poor
Gertie alone with her sad thoughts. Till at
length the day came when inquiry was vain.
The blinds were drawn close in the house across
the square; the accustomed walk in the garden
was omitted; for the little sister’s pure innocent
spirit had passed away into eternal peace; and
ere yet the mourning-frocks worn for their
mother were laid aside, baby Ethel had gone to
join her in the better home, and Gertrude had
another sweet memory to treasure up in her young
heart, another heavy grief to add intensity to the
pathos of her soft brown eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">{346}</span></p>

<p>Many months passed without my catching more
than a passing glimpse of the young mourners.
The garden had too many associations with the
past to be any longer the scene of Edith’s romps
or Gertrude’s daily walks; and it was only when
I happened by accident to meet the children in
the street, or to get a distant peep at them in the
gardens of the Temple, now their chosen resort,
that I could judge of my favourite’s recovery of
her spirits, or admire the delicate beauty which
grew with her growth. She was fulfilling the
promise of her childhood, and ripening into a
quiet pensive style of beauty, forming a more
marked contrast than ever to the vivacious
younger sister, whose chatter and merry laugh
rippled through the cloistered precincts of the
Temple, and drew many a backward glance from
the blue-bag laden lads passing through these
quiet courts. Then came a long break in my
connection with our square. Duty called me
from England for a spell of some years, and on
my return to the familiar scenes, I found it
impossible to take up the old threads of association,
and to recognise, in the grown youths and
maidens who played lawn-tennis in the well-known
garden, the little ones whom I had seen
playing under care of nurses and governesses on
those grass plots in my student days. I was
forced to form a new circle of acquaintances-by-sight,
among another generation of children, and
I looked in vain for any among the gay tennis-players
to remind me of the sombre-clad sisters,
in whose childish joys and sorrows I had learned
to feel so deep an interest.</p>

<p>Not long after my return to England, I was
present, one summer night, at a large party
given by a neighbour of ours in the square. It
was a sultry evening, and the gas-lighted drawing-room,
stripped of its furniture, and given up to
such indefatigable dancers as will not be daunted
by a thermometer standing at fabulous figures
in the shade, had no attraction for a lazy non-dancer
like myself. I therefore strayed, shortly
after midnight, into the cooler atmosphere of
an anteroom, where card-tables were set out,
and a few of the quieter sort were enjoying a
rubber within hearing-distance of the music. One
of the players rose from his seat as I entered,
and moved towards the folding-doors which
opened into the drawing-room. There he stood
for a moment or two watching the waltz, and
then beckoned to some one among the dancers.
From my quiet corner I saw a young couple
approach in answer to his sign, and a happy,
ringing voice entreated for one more dance.</p>

<p>‘I have promised it to Gerald, father, and
he will be so disappointed if I go before he
has had it. Just this one more, and I will
come.’</p>

<p>‘Very well, dear,’ he replied. ‘But then we
must really be going. Remember, you will have
a tiring day to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘It is because of to-morrow that I don’t want
to disappoint Gerald to-night,’ she answered,
smiling to her partner. ‘He won’t care to waltz
with me after to-morrow.’ Gerald did not look
as if he indorsed this statement, which was made
with a pretty affectation of despair; and the
couple were just turning to the dancing-room
again, when the gentleman she had addressed
as ‘father’ asked: ‘Where is Gertrude?’</p>

<p>‘She was with Mrs Gaythorn a few minutes ago,’
replied the girl.—‘Oh! here she comes.’</p>

<p>I glanced at the approaching figure, and
instantly recognised my favourite of days gone
by. She had fully realised all my expectations
of her. Tall, graceful, beautifully moulded in
face and figure, there was all the old pensiveness
and the sweet half-melancholy of expression; and
as she met my gaze, standing in her white cloud-like
draperies in the shadow of the doorway, I
could see at once that she was utterly unconscious
of her loveliness, and unspoiled by the admiration
it must win. I could not, even at the risk of
appearing impertinent, resist the pleasure of
studying her beauty and noting the grace of
every movement and gesture. Fortunately, the
corner in which I had ensconced myself was
shaded, and my admiration passed unnoticed and
unrebuked. I watched her as she courteously
but decidedly declined the invitations of two or
three eager candidates for the dance; and when
at last the waltz was over, and the pretty girl I
had before noticed came back, leaning on her
partner’s arm, and showing me in her <i>riante</i>
features a dim resemblance to the merry little
Edith of my earlier recollections, I followed the
party down-stairs. Then having seen them don
their wraps and start two and two, Gertrude with
her father, and Edith with the happy Gerald, to
walk round to their own side of the square, I
took my hat and strolled home, my mind full of
the sad memories of the old days when I used
to watch the little trio of serious faces from my
study window.</p>

<p>The following morning broke with a cloudless
sky and brilliant sunshine, even in our gloomy
old-fashioned quarter of London. I was taking a
half-holiday that day; but feeling disinclined for
exertion, I contented myself with a volume of
Thackeray and a seat under the plane-trees in the
square garden, where the sparrows were twittering
with a specious make-believe of being in the
country. My book lay neglected at my side,
and my thoughts were wandering again to the
past, prompted by my <i>rencontre</i> of the previous
night. Half curiously, I turned from the contemplation
of the groups of youngsters playing on the
grass, to look up at the windows of the house
in which my little friends had lived. A carriage
and a cab stood at the door; and even as I looked,
the door itself was opened, and a procession of
trunks and bonnet-boxes was carried down the
steps and deposited on the roof of the cab.
Among the luggage was an unquestionably male
portmanteau; and it needed not the white rosettes
worn by the servants to suggest to me the meaning
of these preparations. The despairing glance and
mock-mournful suggestion that ‘Gerald will not
care to waltz with me after to-morrow,’ recurred to
my mind, confirming my conclusion. Five minutes
more and the doorway was filled with a group
of host and guests bidding farewell to the happy
couple. Edith—the brightness of her eyes slightly
dimmed as she clung to her father and sister
in a last embrace—forced a glad smile through
her tears as she turned to her young husband.
Together they passed down the steps and entered
the waiting carriage. A parting cheer, a shower
of rice and satin shoes, a rattle of wheels upon
the stony street, and in a moment the carriage
turned the corner of the square and disappeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">{347}</span>
from sight. Gertrude, who with her father and
one or two of their guests had remained at the
foot of the steps, to see the last glimpse of her
sister, now turned to re-enter the house. But
before they passed out of earshot, I heard one
of the elder gentlemen exclaim, in a tone of
banter: ‘Well, Miss Gertrude, I suppose it
won’t be long before we see some fine young
fellow coming to carry you off; and then, what
will your poor father do without his housekeeper?’</p>

<p>Gertrude turned at the words, and met her
father’s eyes with an expression of true, lasting,
unselfish affection, which disposed of any need
for answering this question. There was no misconstruing
its meaning, no room to doubt its
changeless truth. Her father took the hand she
had slipped into his own, and pressed it closely,
without speaking a word. So they moved slowly
up the steps and into the house. The door closed;
and the picture of sweet unspoken confidence
passed from my eyes, to be engraved indelibly
on my memory, the closing scene of the simple
drama of everyday life, of which I had so long
been an unknown and unsuspected witness.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="AN_INTERESTING_ISLAND">AN INTERESTING ISLAND.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are few subjects of more general interest
to the inhabitants of this country than agriculture,
in one form or another. To those who earn their
bread by tilling the soil, it is of the first importance;
to those who do not, it is of importance
as indirectly affecting their material prosperity.
But apart from the question of pecuniary interest,
there is an inborn love of agricultural pursuits,
which is a national characteristic. In some few
privileged persons the taste shows itself so strongly
as to lead them to indulge in farming for pleasure.
Others, whose time and means will not allow of
this, it leads to employ much of their leisure
time in gardening. Many are obliged to confine
its indulgence to tending a few flowers in pots.
They are very few indeed who feel no interest
whatever in the subject. The trait has shown
itself more or less in all the greatest races that
have swayed the destiny of the world. The
haughty Roman dictator who yesterday was omnipotent,
is content to-day to return humbly to his
farm, and exercise his authority not over a nation,
but over a team of oxen.</p>

<p>A peculiarly interesting example of the splendid
results which have been brought about by this
national taste is presented by the island of Ascension,
which has been transformed from a comparatively
barren rock, exposed to the most terrific
and damaging winds, producing scarce enough
of the coarsest vegetation to afford a meagre
sustenance to a few wild goats, into a pleasant
and fertile island, amply supporting in comfort
and luxury a very considerable population. This
change it took some time and considerable trouble
to effect; but before indicating how it was
brought about, a short history and description
of the island itself may not be out of place.</p>

<p>The island owes its name to having been discovered
on Ascension Day in the year 1501, by
the Portuguese navigator Juan de Nova Gallego.
Two years later it was visited by Alfonzo
d’Albuquerque; and from time to time other
navigators landed, among them Captain Cook.
Such was its dreary aspect, however, that no one
was induced to settle on it. But ‘Jack’ has
always been famous for his ingenuity, and even
here it did not fail him. In the north-west part
of the island, which affords the best anchorage
for ships, there is a small inlet called Sandy Bay.
One of the rocks near the landing-place contains
a very curious crevice. This was soon christened
‘The Sailors’ Post-office;’ and it became an established
custom to leave letters there, well corked
up in a bottle, which were always taken to their
respective destinations by the first ship bound
thither which happened to call. This seems to
have been the sole use made of the island till
the year 1815, when it was taken possession of
by the English, who erected a fort and placed
a garrison on it soon after the banishment of
Napoleon to St Helena.</p>

<p>Ascension is situated far out in the Atlantic
Ocean, off the coast of Africa, and eight hundred
miles north-west of St Helena. It is of a triangular
shape, eight miles long, and six broad
at its widest part, with an area of thirty-four
square miles. It is one of the peaks of the submarine
ridge which separates the northern and
southern basins of the Atlantic. Its volcanic
origin is clearly shown by the numerous crevices
and ravines into which its surface is broken, and
which are filled with scoria, pumice-stone, and
other igneous products. The highest peak, called
the Green Mountain, rises to a height of two
thousand eight hundred and seventy feet. From
this the land, on the north, sinks gradually
towards the shore; but on the south it terminates
in bold lofty precipices. Communication with
the shore is frequently rendered dangerous by
the setting in of heavy seas or rollers, which rise
suddenly in the most perfect calm, and break
with tremendous force on the beach. The cause
of this phenomenon is unknown. Only such
plants as required very little water were to be
found. Of these, the tomato, castor-oil plant,
pepper, and Cape gooseberry were the chief. It
was always famed for its turtles, which abound
to such an extent that as many as two thousand
five hundred have been captured in one year.
They are now usually collected into two ponds or
crawls, the water of which is occasionally changed.
They can be obtained only by purchase, any one
taking them on the beach or near the island
being liable to a heavy penalty. Fish abound,
of which the conger-eel is the most prized.
Another indigenous delicacy is the egg of the
tropical swallow, or ‘wide-awake’ as it is called
on the island. They are largely used as an article
of food, ten thousand dozen being frequently
gathered in a week. In addition to the goats
referred to above, the only other useful product
was the wild guinea-fowl, which were found in
considerable numbers.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s presence, even as a prisoner, in
the island of St Helena determined the English
government to place a garrison on Ascension.
This was in 1815; and for years that garrison
was entirely supported on food and water brought
there at great expense by ships. The death of
the illustrious prisoner in 1821 did away with the
immediate necessity for keeping a garrison there;
but the Admiralty were anxious if possible to
turn the island into a victualling station for the
African squadron. To ascertain the practicability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">{348}</span>
of this plan, they appointed Captain
Brandreth, in 1829, to make a thorough survey,
and use every effort to discover water. We can
imagine him diligently examining every portion
of the barren and uninviting rock, long discouraged
by want of success. With indefatigable
zeal, he and his willing workers sank shaft after
shaft in the hope of discovering a spring, however
far down. His strong belief that one did exist was
at length justified. In the Green Mountain, at
a great level from the sea, he found one at a depth
of twenty-five feet which proved to be capable of
supplying all the wants of the island. Large
tanks were at once made and piping laid to the
garrison.</p>

<p>Having now an abundance of water, the most
vigorous efforts were put forth to bring some of
the land under cultivation. The most promising
parts of the Green Mountain were first
planted; and sheltered spots in other parts of the
island were chosen, and the ground broken up
and irrigated. Recourse was even had to excavating
in the side of the mountain, in order to gain
the desired shelter. The government did all in
their power to insure the success of these
attempts. They sent out a trained head-gardener
from the Kew Gardens, who took the utmost
interest in his work. Great progress was made
with the planting of young trees, shrubs, furze,
grasses, and hardy plants. The Australian wattle
was perhaps the most successful. Holes four
feet wide and three deep were prepared, in which
it was planted in layers. The hardiness and
rapid growth of these may be seen from the fact,
that in twelve months they reached an average
of between six and seven feet in height. Among
the grasses early tried was one kind known by
the name of ‘Para,’ a case of which was sent out
by Sir William Hooker, of the Royal Gardens,
Kew, who always took great interest in the
cultivation of Ascension. This grass succeeded
admirably, increasing in the most astounding
manner, and growing down all weeds and inferior
grasses. In 1861, Captain Bernard was appointed
governor of the island, and by that time the most
thankless part of the task of bringing Ascension
into cultivation had been accomplished. He
displayed, however, the full zeal of his predecessors;
and with the able assistance of Mr Bell, the
head-gardener, accomplished wonders in the next
few years. A scarcity of manure was one great
drawback. This was supplied by using the guano
which was found in large quantities on Boatswain
Bird Island, a small rock that lies off the west
coast of Ascension. This is now largely supplemented
by the manure supplied by the cattle,
the island being able to support a large number
without any imported food. The rapidity with
which sheep fatten on the grass is very satisfactory,
nearly doubling their weight in three
months after importation.</p>

<p>The island is by no means free from vermin.
The horses and cattle suffer greatly from a fly,
in appearance like the house-fly, but which bites
venomously, and causes intense irritation. The
‘black grub,’ as it is called there, effects great
devastation at times among the plants, and as
yet no practical remedy has been found for its
ravages. The next destructive enemy is the
field-rat, which attacks the root-crops, and feeds
principally on the sweet-potato. Land-crabs, too,
exist in very large numbers, and add to the
destruction. Another animal, the wild-cat, proves
itself an enemy, as it lives on the rabbits, and is
useless as a vermin destroyer. A determined war
is being waged against all these tormentors, a
regular system of trapping having been set on foot.
In one year, fifty-three cats, seven thousand four
hundred rats, and eighty-five thousand one hundred
and fifty land-crabs, were destroyed. The
thorough cultivation of the ground is also being
furthered by the introduction of rooks, minhas,
and other birds that help the farmer. With all
these drawbacks, the island has been brought
step by step from its original barrenness to such
a pleasing condition, that we now have over
thirty-one acres under actual cultivation, producing
among other things, sweet and English
potatoes, cabbage, carrots, pumpkins, and turnips;
pine-apples, bananas, endive, French beans, leeks,
herbs, seedling date-palm, and coffee; sugar-cane,
guavas, oranges, shaddocks, fig bushes, mulberries,
and cuttings of shrubs. There is good pasturage
one thousand acres in extent for cattle, and five
thousand acres for sheep, supporting easily over
forty head of cattle and between seven and eight
hundred sheep. Parts of the island are now well
wooded, and about forty acres are laid out in
fruit-trees and shrubbery. Few brighter monuments
could be pointed out of the success sure
to attend the enterprise and unyielding zeal of
a nation when well and wisely directed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MONTH">THE MONTH:
<br />
SCIENCE AND ARTS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr Petrie’s</span> excavations in Upper Egypt, to
which we briefly alluded last month, have already
made considerable progress, and no fewer than
one hundred and forty labourers are busily at
work upon them. To some extent, the discoveries
made possess that peculiar interest which attaches
to the excavations at Pompeii, for they bear
witness to the home-life of a people that lived
many centuries ago. Thus, the walls of the now
exhumed temple have had built upon them at a
remote period various private dwellings. In one
of these, apparently lived an artist, who possibly
was engaged upon the decoration of the temple
itself; his sketch-book and eraser—represented by
a slab of fine limestone and a piece of black emery—have
been found. The limestone is ruled in
squares, just in the same way that a modern artist
will rule his paper preparatory to making a
drawing ‘to scale.’ Other houses seem to have
been used as workshops for a Company of jewellers,
for chips of carnelian, lapis-lazuli, and other valued
stones have been found there, together with waste
metal from copper working. A box filled with
rolls of burned papyri, upon which, however, the
writing is still legible, is considered one of the
most important finds. Mr Petrie is careful to
examine every block of stone and every brick in
search of inscriptions. Every inscription so found
is carefully copied, and every other object of
interest is photographed. The work is evidently
being carried on with both energy and skill.</p>

<p>Another important archæological discovery has
been made also in Upper Egypt by Professor
Maspero, who has found between Assiout and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">{349}</span>
Thebes the hitherto unsuspected site of a vast
necropolis. Five catacombs have been already
opened, and have yielded one hundred and twenty
mummies; and Professor Maspero in a cursory
manner has fixed the positions of more than one
hundred of such sepulchres. We may therefore
conclude that some thousands of embalmed bodies
lie in this old cemetery, many of them probably of
historical interest. In addition to the mummies,
there will also be many treasures, in the shape of
papyri, &amp;c., which experience has taught us to
look for. It seems to be something more than a
fortunate accident that so many ancient peoples
were moved to bury with their dead, relics connected
with the arts or pursuits of the deceased.</p>

<p>A Canadian correspondent of <i>Nature</i> gives a
curious and interesting account of a phenomenon
often to be seen on Lake Ontario during the prevalence
of cold and stormy weather, such as the
past season has afforded. ‘Ice volcanoes,’ as they
are aptly named, are formed by an uneven strip of
ice accumulating along the shore, on which appear
mounds twenty or thirty feet in height. Many of
these mounds are conical in form, and often have
a crater-like opening, communicating with the
water beneath. In stormy weather, every wave
dashes spray and fragments of ice through this
opening, which congeal upon the sides of the cone
and add to its height; just in the same way that
the fragments of pumice and other material ejected
from a fiery volcano gradually build it up into a
mountain. But the ice volcano soon becomes
extinct, for the crater is gradually clogged up
with ice, and the irruption can no longer find a
vent.</p>

<p>M. Trouvelet, who for the last nine years has
been engaged in studying and mapping the configuration
of the planet Mars, which, although not
our nearest neighbour in the solar system, is that
most conveniently situated for telescopic observation,
has just presented a Report of his labours
to the French Academy of Sciences. Sir W.
Herschel long ago discovered that the polar patches
of white on Mars increased and decreased in size
in the winter and summer seasons of the planet,
in the same manner as is experienced in the like
regions of our own earth. Other observers have
also mapped out the distant orb into regions of
supposed land and sea, sometimes obscured by
belts of cloud; moreover, the spectroscope has
revealed to us, in its own wonderful way, the
undoubted presence of water upon the planet.
What are believed to be the continents of Mars
are covered with faint grayish spots; and as these
spots change their form and volume with the
changes of the Martial seasons, M. Trouvelet
supposes them to represent masses of vegetation
which grow and die under the same solar
influences which affect our own globe. Every
contribution towards our knowledge of distant
worlds—many of them proved to be so much
greater than our own globe—must always have
a fascinating interest for us.</p>

<p>The ingenious individual who lately accounted
for the possession of a suspicious amount of
dynamite by the statement that he used it as a
remedy for chapped hands, may be congratulated
upon pointing out a legitimate use for that commodity,
although we trust that the majority of
sufferers from injured cuticle will be content with
glycerine in an uncombined form. Hitherto,
almost the only legally recognised use for the
explosive has been for mining operations, and
without doubt it has in this connection been of
immense service. Attempts to use dynamite for
firearms or artillery have hitherto failed because
the explosive action is so rapid that the strongest
barrel is shattered. Indeed, dynamite was employed
by our naval brigade at the late bombardment
of Alexandria for destroying the guns of a
deserted fort. For such purposes, and for torpedo
warfare, dynamite is invaluable; but hitherto it
has been found impossible to use it in gunnery.
An entirely new form of weapon has, however,
recently been tried with success in the United
States, in which dynamite, although not representing
the propelling force, plays an important
part. The new form of gun consists of a tube
forty feet in length, made rigid by being fixed to a
steel girder. By means of compressed air, a dart-like
projectile charged with dynamite is propelled
with great force from the tube. The weapon
already tried has only a two-inch bore; but with
an air-pressure of four hundred and twenty pounds
on the square inch, a range of a mile and a quarter
is attained. With the four and six inch weapons
now in course of construction, it is believed that,
with increased pressure, a range of three miles will
be possible. The guns can be cheaply made, and
are free from smoke or noise; while their destructive
power must be far greater than those heavy
guns whose shells can only be charged with gunpowder.</p>

<p>In our own navy, a new form of machine-gun
will be probably supplied to the various ships,
more especially for boat-service. For some time
the Nordenfelt gun has been a service-fitting;
but it is now proposed to introduce a Nordenfelt
of larger calibre, which will fire explosive shells
instead of solid bullets. From recent experiments
at Portsmouth, the new weapon seems to be wonderfully
efficient. For instance, a gun firing a
shell weighing only two pounds was able to send
its projectile through a solid steel plate two inches
thick at a range of three hundred yards. It was
shown, too, that a far larger Nordenfelt, a six-pounder,
could be fired from a boat without
straining it. These destructive weapons can be
fired so rapidly as to deliver from eighteen to
twenty-five shots per minute.</p>

<p>The <i>Telegraphist</i> newspaper publishes an account
of what must be regarded as a truly marvellous
triumph of electrical communication, before which
Puck’s proposal to ‘put a girdle round the earth
in forty minutes’ seems to be quite a second-rate
achievement. A correspondent of the paper
in question visited the office of the Indo-European
Telegraph Company by invitation, in order to
note how good signalling could be maintained
over thousands of miles of wire. First, a few
words of conversation were exchanged with the
telegraphist of a German town. The wire was
next connected with Odessa, and next with the
Persian capital (Teheran). In a few more minutes
the experimenters in London were talking with
the clerk in charge at Kurrachee; next they had
a chat with a gentleman at Agra; and as a final
triumph of science, the line was made direct
between London and Calcutta, a distance of seven
thousand miles. It is said that the signals were
excellent, and the speed attained about thirteen
words per minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">{350}</span></p>

<p>In a recent lecture upon gas-lighting, Mr
Thomas Fletcher pointed out that blackened ceilings
and darkened picture-frames are not due to
smoke from the gas-burners, but are caused by
floating particles of dust being caught in the flame
and thrown against the ceiling. It is easily proved,
by holding a glass tumbler for a few seconds over
a flame, that water is one of the products of combustion
of gas. This water condenses upon a cold
ceiling when the gas in a room is first lighted,
so that the burnt particles of dust readily adhere
to the flat surface. The servant who lights the
gas on a dark morning before she proceeds to
sweep and dust the room does practically all the
smoking of the ceiling that takes place.</p>

<p>That unfortunate commercial experiment, but
marvellous triumph of engineering skill, the
<i>Great Eastern</i> steamship, will shortly proceed to
Gibraltar to take up her position in the harbour
as a coal-hulk. The gigantic paddles with their
engines will be removed, leaving the screw propeller
only to carry the ship to her last berth.
The Admiralty authorities look with much favour
upon the scheme, for the immense ship will
supersede a number of small coal-hulks which
now encumber the harbour, and are a source of
much inconvenience to other vessels. We are glad
that a use has been found for the unwieldy vessel,
whose only serviceable work has been as the layer
of the first Atlantic cables. She was far too big
to be profitably worked, and has for many years
been lying idle. Her new vocation, although
of a lowly kind, is at anyrate better than
pauperism.</p>

<p>A new motor, called a ‘Triple Thermic Motor,’
has, it is said, been in use in New York for the
past seven months driving a sixty horse-power
engine. Heat is generated by a fifteen horse-power
boiler, and the steam thus raised is carried
to a receptacle containing carbon disulphide,
which passes into vapour at one hundred and
eighteen degrees Fahrenheit. An engineer, in
reporting upon this new contrivance, says that
the fifteen horse-power boiler with very little
fire under it generates steam, which operates the
motor, which in turn runs the sixty horse-power
engine. These seem to be all the particulars
published; and it would be interesting to have
details of the motor, if it be really as successful
as reported. There are one or two difficulties to
surmount in the employment of carbon disulphide.
It has a most disagreeable and penetrating odour;
its vapour is highly inflammable; and lastly, it is
by no means cheap.</p>

<p>Some interesting particulars of the American
lead-pencil trade have recently been published.
With the improved machinery now in use, it is
possible for ten men to turn out four thousand
pencils a day. The cedar comes from Florida in
slabs cut to pencil-length. Four parallel grooves
are sawn in each little slab, each groove being
destined to hold the lead, or rather graphite. The
so-called leads are kept in hot glue, and after
being inserted in the grooves, are covered over
with a thin slab of cedar, also glued; then the
whole is passed through a moulding-machine,
and comes out at the other side in the form of
four finished pencils. The graphite is mixed with
a variable amount of white clay—the greater the
proportion of clay the harder the pencil—and is
ground with moisture into a paste. The paste
is pressed into dies, and is baked at a high
temperature.</p>

<p>The recent outbreak of smallpox in London
reminds us that we have not yet succeeded in
stamping out this loathsome disease, although
the practice of vaccination has checked it to a
wonderful extent. Anti-vaccination agitators are
very fond of pointing to the circumstance that
many persons who have been apparently successfully
vaccinated in childhood are in after-years
attacked with smallpox. This is perfectly true;
and statistics are available which show that in
the years between 1871 and 1881 nearly eighteen
thousand such cases were treated in the London
hospitals. But the popular agitator abstains from
pointing out that in ninety per cent. of these
cases the sufferers were above ten years of age.
These figures prove, in fact, what has been long
ago acknowledged, that vaccination does not afford
permanent protection. When a child reaches
adult age, revaccination should take place. In
our smallpox hospitals, the nurses and attendants
enjoy complete immunity from infection by taking
care to adopt this precaution; and all persons, for
the general good of the community at large, would
do well to submit to the trifling inconvenience
which the operation entails.</p>

<p>The Isthmus of Corinth Canal, a scheme which
was promoted originally so far back as the time
of the emperor Nero, is now almost an accomplished
fact. The dredging operations at the
approaches to the canal proceed very rapidly,
for about five thousand cubic metres of soil and
sand are removed every twenty-four hours. There
are large numbers of workmen employed also on
the central portions of the channel, and they
have the help of railway and plant for the conveyance
of material. A new town, called Isthmia,
has sprung into being, and it contains some two
hundred houses and stores.</p>

<p>‘The Rivers Congo and Niger viewed as
Entrances for the Introduction of Civilisation
into Mid-Africa,’ was the title of a paper lately
read before the Society of Arts by Mr R. Capper,
Lloyd’s agent for the district of the Congo. The
lecturer stated that within the past five years,
the western African trade has quadrupled in value.
Twelve years ago there were but four English
houses, one French, and one Dutch, trading up
the Congo. There are now upon the river’s
banks forty-nine European factories, and the
imports and exports are valued at two millions
sterling. Mr Capper pointed out that the great
value of these rivers lies in the possibility of
connecting them with future railways. Such
railways could be easily laid, for the interior of
Africa is one vast tableland. A railway across
the Desert of Sahara would turn a perilous
journey of four months into one of twenty-four
hours. By such means the interior slave-trade
would be annihilated.</p>

<p>Boring in the earth for water is an operation
often attended by great uncertainty. Some few
years ago in the heart of London a firm of brewers
bored to a depth of several hundred yards without
tapping the precious fluid, and the expensive well
had to be abandoned. Quite recently, at Burton-on-Trent
a similar failure occurred upon a far
smaller scale. When the operators had pierced
to a depth of one hundred and seventy-six feet
without finding water, they called in the advice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">{351}</span>
of some experienced artesian-well engineers, who
recommended the abandonment of the works, and
the commencement of a fresh bore upon a site
which they selected two hundred yards away. At
a depth of only one hundred and fourteen feet,
a copious supply of water was found, yielding,
in fact, between five and six thousand gallons per
hour. It is remarkable that the sites of both
bores were at the same level.</p>

<h3>THE RECENT EARTHQUAKE IN ENGLAND.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the past few years, there have been
recorded, unhappily, an unusual number of earthquakes
in various parts of the world; and many
thousands of lives have been lost by those terrible
convulsions of nature. Inhabitants of Britain,
although constant in their complaints of fog,
inclement seasons, and other meteorological inconveniences,
have hitherto congratulated themselves
upon living in a country which is exempt from
volcanic phenomena, and in which earthquakes
seemed to be things of a past era. These comfortable
reflections were suddenly dispelled on the
morning of the 22d of April, when over a large
tract of country in Southern England a shock of
great severity occurred. In the town of Colchester,
and many villages eastward of it, the destruction
of houses was very great. Many were entirely
unroofed; and in some villages, as the writer can
testify from personal observation, it was the exception
to note a dwelling in which the chimney-stacks
had not been demolished. Providentially,
no lives were lost, although several narrow escapes
have been recorded. The damage is estimated
to amount to several thousand pounds, and unfortunately
the sufferers are as a rule very poor
cottagers, who are unable to bear the expense of
the necessary repairs. For their relief, a subscription
has been set on foot under the auspices
of the Lord Mayor, and there is little doubt that
sufficient money will be readily forthcoming for
their needs.</p>

<p>The occurrence of such a rare phenomenon in
the British Isles—not quite so rare, by the
way, as some people imagine, for nearly three
hundred shocks have been actually recorded—has
caused an immense amount of earthquake lore
to be unearthed and published in the various
newspapers. From <i>Iron</i> we have an interesting
account of the way in which luminous paint is
utilised in connection with earthquake alarms in
countries where such visitations are prevalent.
We are informed that large consignments of the
paint are sent to such places, and that the material
is employed in the following manner. Small
metallic plates covered with the paint are fixed on
the doorposts of the different rooms, so that at
the first alarm—and happily there is often a premonitory
warning of something more serious to
follow—the inmates of the houses can readily find
their way outside. In Manila, the paint is laid
in patches about the staircases, door-handles, and
various points of egress. A light which gives off
neither fire nor heat is of the greatest value in
such situations, where any other form of light
would be apt to add its quota of disaster to the
dangers to life, already too prominent.</p>


<h3>IMPROVED ELECTRIC LIGHTING FOR SHIPS.</h3>

<p>Mr J. D. F. Andrews, Woodside Electric Works,
Glasgow, has lighted with electricity, after a new
fashion, the North German Lloyd <span class="allsmcap">S.S.</span> <i>Ems</i>. The
system, which includes over three hundred and
twenty incandescent lamps and a masthead arc
lamp, presents some features of a novel and
important character. In the case of the small
lights, Swan’s lamps and Siemen’s machines are
employed. The wires are all completely hidden,
but they are nevertheless arranged in such a way
that they can be easily reached when necessary.
For these lamps there is provided a new style
of holder, which is at once simple and efficient.
Each lamp has its own switch, which is entirely
of metal; and it is provided with a lead-wire,
which fuses in the event of the current being
too strong. In the case of every set of about
twenty lamps there is another switch, so that the
lights can be turned on and off in groups as well
as individually; and another lead-wire, so that
the leading wires may be protected from too
strong a current. The whole system is such as
to preclude the possibility of fire. Duplicate
machines are fitted up to guard against any breakdown,
and either of them can be started or stopped
without interfering with the engine which drives
them. The masthead arc lamp, of which Mr
Andrews is the inventor, is here brought into
requisition for the first time. It has about five
thousand candle-power concentrated in a single
beam of light, that can be moved in any direction
forward of the ship. In construction it is
extremely simple, consisting merely of a cylinder
and piston, the former being an electrical coil of
wire. The illuminating power of the lamp is so
great that by means of it an object half a mile
away can be clearly distinguished by the naked
eye on a dark night.</p>


<h3>DUTCH RUSH.</h3>

<p>‘Many years ago,’ says Mr W. Mathieu Williams,
in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for March, ‘when the
electrotype process was a novelty, I devoted a
considerable amount of time and attention to
the reproduction of medallions and other plaster-casts
in copper by electro deposition. This
brought me in contact with many of those worthy
and industrious immigrants from Bagni di Lucca
(between Lucca and Pisa), who form a large section
of the Italian colony of Leather Lane and its
surroundings. These Lucchesi are the image-makers
and image-sellers, and general workers
in plaster of Paris. Among other useful lessons
I learned from them was the use of the so-called
Dutch rushes, which are the dried stems of one
of the most abundant species of the equisetum
(<i>Equisetum hyemale</i>) or “horse-tail,” which grows
on wet ground in this country and Holland. It
is well known to practical agriculturists as a tell-tale,
indicating want of drainage.</p>

<p>‘Plaster-casts are made by pouring plaster of
Paris, mixed to a creamy consistence with water,
into a mould made of many pieces, which pieces
are again held together in an outer or “case-mould”
of two or three pieces. When the mould is
removed piece by piece, fine ridges stand up on
the cast where the plaster has flowed between
these pieces. These ridges are removed by rubbing
them obliquely with the surface of the stem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">{352}</span>
of the dried equisetum. It cuts away the plaster as
rapidly as a file, but without leaving any visible
file-marks. The surface left is much smoother
than from fine emery or glass-paper, and the rush
does not clog nearly so fast as the paper.</p>

<p>‘In order to find the explanation of this, I carefully
burned some small pieces of the equisetum
stem, mounted the unbroken ash on microscope
slides with Canada balsam, and examined its
structure. This displayed a flinty cuticle, a scale-armour
made up of plates of silica, each plate
interlocking with its neighbours by means of
beautifully regular angular teeth, forming myriads
of microscopic saw-blades, which become loosened
from each other and crumpled up in drying, and
thus present their teeth obliquely to the surface.
These teeth supply the image-maker with a file
of exquisite fineness, and harder than the best
Sheffield steel. Their comparative freedom from
clogging I think must be due to their loose aggregation
while held by the dried and shrivelled
woody tissue of the sub-cuticle.</p>

<p>‘This natural file is used for other purposes,
such as the polishing of ivory, hard woods, and
metal, but is only understood in certain obscure
industrial corners. I here commend it to the
attention of my readers, because I have just discovered
a new use for it. Like many others, I
have been occasionally troubled by minute irregularities
of the teeth, lacerating the tongue, and
producing small ulcerations, which, I am told,
are dangerous to those who have passed middle
age, being provocative of cancer. A friendly
dentist has ground down the offending projections
with his emery-wheel, and thus supplied
relief. But in course of time other sharp angles
have stood forth, but so trivial that I felt ashamed
of visiting the torture-chamber for their removal.
I tried emery paper; but it was ineffectual and
unpleasant, as the emery rubbed off. Then I
tried the Dutch rush, rubbing its surface crosswise
and obliquely against the offending angles.
The success was complete, both grinding down
and smoothing being effected by one and the
same operation.’</p>


<h3>LIGHTNING-STROKES IN FRANCE.</h3>

<p>M. Cochery, the French Minister of Posts and
Telegraphs, has presented to the French Academy
of Sciences a Report on the lightning-strokes in
France during the last half of 1883. During
the month of July there were no fewer than
one hundred and forty-three strokes in France,
thirty of these occurring on the 10th, and thirty-two
on the 3d. Seven men, four women, a
young girl, and a child were killed by these
strokes, and over forty persons were injured,
including ten men who were affected by the same
flash, which struck a plane-tree in their neighbourhood.
Nine horses were also injured by the
flash in question, which happened at Castres, in
the department of Tarn, at 9.15 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on July 4.
The same storm also killed a woman at Castres,
three-quarters of an hour earlier. The total
number of animals killed during July was fifty-seven,
including a calf, two horses, three sheep,
one goat, one dog, and one chicken; while fourteen
cows, eleven horses, one dog, and a goose
were injured. In general, the strokes were
attracted by poplar-trees, or masts, chimneys, and
steeples, as well as elm, oak, and fir trees. The
stems and points of lightning-rods have also been
struck, the latter being fused, and the former
heated red-hot. The wire used to support vines
has also drawn the stroke. In the majority of
cases, rain, often abundant, attended the discharge.
In August there were only nine strokes, as compared
with one hundred and forty-three in July;
six persons were killed, and two bulls were injured.
In September there were fourteen strokes, killing
four persons and six animals, and injuring ten
persons in all. In October there was only one
stroke, on the 16th (4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>), at Castellane, in the
Basses-Alpes. In November and December there
are no strokes recorded.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
